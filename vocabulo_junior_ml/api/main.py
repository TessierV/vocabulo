"""
This module provides the main API endpoints for processing images using FastAPI.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Handling image uploads and processing them.
- Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the uploaded images.
- Cleaning and normalizing the extracted text.
- Processing the normalized text to extract meaningful information.

Dependencies:
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- core.image_processing: Module for handling image format conversions and validations.
- core.ocr: Module for performing OCR on images.
- core.text_processing: Module for cleaning, normalizing, and processing text.

Endpoints:
- POST /process-image/: Endpoint to process an uploaded image file and return the extracted and processed text.

Example usage:
    To use this API, send a POST request to the /process-image/ endpoint with an image file.
    The response will contain the original text extracted from the image and the processed results.
