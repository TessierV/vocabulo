"""
This module provides the functionality to obtain embeddings for sentences using the CamemBERT model.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Loading the SpaCy model for French language processing.
- Loading the CamemBERT tokenizer and model.
- Obtaining the CamemBERT embedding for a given sentence.

Dependencies:
- spacy: Library for advanced natural language processing.
- transformers: Library for state-of-the-art natural language processing models.
- torch: Library for tensor computation and deep learning.

Functions:
- get_camembert_embedding(sentence): Obtains the CamemBERT embedding for a given sentence.

Example usage:
    To obtain the embedding for a sentence, call the `get_camembert_embedding` function:

    embedding = get_camembert_embedding(sentence)

    This will return the embedding of the sentence as a torch.Tensor.
