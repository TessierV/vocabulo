"""
This module contains unit tests for database connection and query execution.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Testing the connection to the database.
- Testing the execution of a simple SQL query.

Dependencies:
- unittest: Unit testing framework.
- core.database: Module for connecting to the database.
- sqlalchemy.exc: Module for SQLAlchemy exceptions.
- sqlalchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

Classes:
- TestDatabaseConnection: Contains unit tests for database connection.
- TestDatabaseQuery: Contains unit tests for executing SQL queries.

Functions:
- setUp(self): Sets up the database engine for the tests.
- test_connect_to_db(self): Tests the connection to the database.
- tearDown(self): Disposes of the database engine after tests.
- test_execute_query(self): Tests the execution of a simple SQL query.

Example usage:
    To run the tests, execute the module as a script:

    python -m unittest test_database.py
