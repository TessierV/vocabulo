"""
This module contains unit tests for the OCR functionalities.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Testing the `perform_ocr` function to ensure it processes images correctly.
- Testing the handling of successful and failed OCR executions.
- Testing the handling of invalid images.

Dependencies:
- unittest: Unit testing framework.
- unittest.mock: Mocking library for unit tests.
- core.ocr: Module for OCR functions.
- PIL: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- subprocess: Module for running subprocesses.

Classes:
- TestOCR: Contains unit tests for the OCR functionalities.

Functions:
- test_perform_ocr_success(self, mock_run): Tests the `perform_ocr` function with a successful OCR execution.
- test_perform_ocr_failure(self, mock_run): Tests the `perform_ocr` function with a failed OCR execution.
- test_perform_ocr_invalid_image(self): Tests the `perform_ocr` function with an invalid image.

Example usage:
    To run the tests, execute the module as a script:

    python -m unittest test_ocr.py
