"""
This module contains unit tests for the image processing functionalities.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Generating an in-memory image for testing.
- Testing the handling of different image formats (JPEG, HEIC, invalid formats).
- Testing the resizing of images that exceed the maximum size.

Dependencies:
- unittest: Unit testing framework.
- PIL: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- io: Core library for handling input and output.
- core.image_processing: Module for image processing functions.
- config: Configuration module for application settings.

Classes:
- TestImageProcessing: Contains unit tests for image processing functionalities.

Functions:
- setUp(self): Sets up the in-memory image for testing.
- test_handle_image_format_jpeg(self): Tests processing a JPEG image.
- test_handle_image_format_heic(self): Tests processing a HEIC image.
- test_handle_image_format_invalid(self): Tests processing an unsupported image format.
- test_resize_image(self): Tests resizing the image if it exceeds the maximum size.
- tearDown(self): Cleans up after tests.

Example usage:
    To run the tests, execute the module as a script:

    python -m unittest test_image_processing.py
