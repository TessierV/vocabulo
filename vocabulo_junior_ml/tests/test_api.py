"""
This module contains unit tests for the FastAPI application endpoints.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Setting up the test client for the FastAPI application.
- Testing the `/process-image/` endpoint to ensure it processes images correctly.

Dependencies:
- unittest: Unit testing framework.
- fastapi.testclient: Test client for FastAPI applications.
- os: Module for interacting with the operating system.
- api.main: FastAPI application instance.

Classes:
- TestAPI: Contains unit tests for the FastAPI application.

Functions:
- setUp(self): Sets up the test client and test image path.
- test_process_image_endpoint(self): Tests the `/process-image/` endpoint to ensure
 it processes images correctly.

Example usage:
    To run the tests, execute the module as a script:

    python -m unittest test_api.py
