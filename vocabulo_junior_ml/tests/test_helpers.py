"""
This module contains unit tests for the NLP models.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Testing the `get_camembert_embedding` function to ensure it returns the correct type and shape.

Dependencies:
- unittest: Unit testing framework.
- models.nlp_models: Module for NLP models and embeddings.
- torch: Library for tensor computation and deep learning.

Classes:
- TestNLPModels: Contains unit tests for the NLP models.

Functions:
- test_get_camembert_embedding(self): Tests the `get_camembert_embedding` function to ensure it returns the correct type and shape.

Example usage:
    To run the tests, execute the module as a script:

    python -m unittest test_helpers.py
