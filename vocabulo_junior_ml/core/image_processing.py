"""
This module provides the functionality to handle and process image files.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Handling the format of uploaded image files.
- Converting HEIC files to a supported format if necessary.
- Resizing images that exceed the maximum allowed size.

Dependencies:
- PIL: Python Imaging Library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
- pillow\_heif: Library for handling HEIC image files.
- config: Module for loading configuration parameters such as the maximum image size.

Functions:
- handle\_image\_format(file\_content): Handles the format of the uploaded image file and returns the processed image.
- resize\_image(image): Resizes the image if it exceeds the maximum allowed size.

Example usage:
    To handle and process an uploaded image file, call the `handle_image_format` function:

    processed_image = handle_image_format(file_content)

    This will return the processed image, which can then be used for further processing.
