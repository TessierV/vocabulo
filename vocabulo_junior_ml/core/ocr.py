"""
This module provides the functionality to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images using a finetuned Tesseract model.

The module includes the following functionalities:
- Saving the image to a temporary file.
- Running Tesseract OCR on the saved image to extract text.
- Handling errors during the OCR process.

Dependencies:
- os: Module for interacting with the operating system.
- subprocess: Module for running subprocesses.
- config: Module for loading Tesseract configuration parameters.

Functions:
- perform_ocr(image): Performs OCR on the provided image and returns the extracted text.

Example usage:
    To perform OCR on an image, call the `perform_ocr` function:

    extracted_text = perform_ocr(image)

    This will return the text extracted from the image.
