"""
Module for testing the recommendation system in the Vocabulo Quizz application.

This module uses the unittest framework to test the FastAPI endpoint for word recommendations.

Modules:
    unittest: Provides a framework for creating and running tests.
    pandas: Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
    fastapi.testclient: Provides a test client for FastAPI applications.
    core.database: Contains functions to interact with the database.
    core.model_loader: Contains functions to load machine learning models.
    api.main: Contains the FastAPI application instance.

Classes:
    TestRecommendations: A unittest.TestCase subclass for testing the recommendation system.
